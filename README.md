# Vision Detection and Movement System for Ball Catching
 The aim of this project was to create a robotic arm which could detect a red ball and catch it in mid-air. Both the vision detection system and the mathematical calculations were done through `Python`. A simulation of the robotic arm placement, based on a random desired point, is shown below.
