# Vision Detection and Movement System for Ball Catching
The aim of this project was to create a 2DOF robotic arm which could detect a red ball and catch it in mid-air. Both the vision detection system and the mathematical calculations were done through `Python`. More specifically, the vision system made use of the `OpenCV` library, both for identifying color as well as tracking the ball. The kinematics portion made use of the math library as well as `Matplotlib` for a visual representation of the system. A simulation of the robotic arm placement, based on a random desired point, is shown below.
